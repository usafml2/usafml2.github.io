        <h2>Electronics and Computer Engineer and Web Developer</h2>

        <p class="profile">As an electronics and computer engineer, I research technologies that cannot mix, and I search for ways to mix them, like TV and telephone, computers and radios, or analog and digital. As a web developer, I try to make web pages that are aesthetically pleasing and functional.</p>
        <p class="profile">I am also reviewing Signals and Systems, studying Fourier Analysis and sampled data systems to understand software defined radio better.</p>

          <p class="job-title">Electronics Engineer at the Naval Avionics Center NAC, Indianapolis, In.
            June 1982 - June 1984</p>
            <div class="full-width"><p class="indent" >I worked in Branch 953, Electronic Warfare Branch. I did design and development work on the AN/ALT-40(V) Airborne Jammer as part of the FAEWS (Fleet Airborne Electronic Warfare System) for (Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group) FEWSG US Navy. At Dahlgren Virgina, Naval Surface Weapons Center, I worked with engineers that developed the prototypes for the AN/ALT-40. I did design and development work for the ACI (Antenna Control Indicator) which contained the Intel 8748 mil-std one chip microcomputer/controller. I worked on software development (assembly language programming) for the Intel 8748 as part of the Antenna Control Indicator (ACI). I also did Hardware development (Computer Circuits, Logic Circuits) for the ACI. I also did development work (Writing Part Specification) for the I/J band MiG 8-18 GHz microwave generator for ALT-40(V). Also, I worked on the automated wire wrap program for automated assembly of the DIB (Data interface Box) and MoG (Modulation Generator) for ALT-40. This work was done on the Honeywell Mainframe Computer using (SHPWRAP), an automated wire wrap program.</p><p class="indent">I also helped innovate wave soldering with a mechanical engineer that built a prototype that NAC began to use. I also proposed the idea of components that could take the heat of the solder wave without damage. They would not be in the wave very long to heat up. Using doped silicon to make resistors was another innovation I proposed.</p></div>
            <p class="job-title">I was a microcomputer control system designer, inventor and Electronic Warfare Engineer.</p>

        <p>Wavetek Indiana. Beach Grove Indiana. A suburb of Indianapolis</p>
        <p>Oct 1980 - Dec 1980 Â· 3 mos</p>
        <p>I worked on the SAM 1 (signal analysis meter). We made cable TV test equipment. The company was located in Beech Grove, a suburb of Indianapolis, In. Mid States Communication was acquired by Wavetek during the time I was there. I started at Mid States Communications and helped move the entire Mid States line of products to the new facility for Wavetek Indiana. I was finishing some work at IUPUI to transfer back to Purdue West Lafayette campus to graduate from Purdue.</p>
        <p>I was an electronics production technician. I temperature tested and aligned the equipment when it came off the assembly line. I used a signal generator and an oscilloscope on external trigger to test for uniformity of response across the band of interest, 0-300 MHz. I would replace temperature sensitive transistors or varactor diodes for the VCO(Voltage Controlled Oscillator). The RF section was in a metal assembly and the IF was coupled out via a coax cable to another board.</p>

              <p>Conducted seismic velocity surveys on oil wells. We determined interval velocities for geophysicists. They then could determine rock type and improve geologic knowledge for an area of interest for oil companies. Exxon was a typical customer in West Texas and other areas.</p>
              <p>Also, I worked on an atomic bomb project in Mercury Nevada in September of 1981. SSC provided geophysical data to a Nevada Test Site (NTS) geophysicist. I was there when the nuclear bomb was detonated underground. We were fingerprinted by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) when we entered the site. I was placing geophones in the ground to aid the geophysical survey process. It was my first experience with surface seismic surveys.</p>
              <p>I completed the breaking out process giving a job description presentation to engineers in Houston Texas with full color slideshow, before the days of Powerpoint presentations.</p>

            <h3>Cleveland Institute of Electronics Correspondence School</h3>
            <p>1971-1976 (approximate)</p>
            <p>The course covered many aspects of electronics, both tubes and transistors. I studied many circuits. I studied the appropriate mathematics, included in the course, for a course of that kind. It included Amplifiers, Oscillators, Filters, Mixers, Detectors, Logic Circuits, Radio Transmitters and Receivers, Television Electronics, Radar equipment, and FCC rules and regulations. AM, FM, RTTY, SSB, Telex, for 2-way Radio Communications and Broadcast Communications.</p>

            <p>A.S.E.E. 1974-1977 (approximate)</p>
            <p>I helped innovate and wrote the first computer graphics program  in Fortran 4 with another freshman researcher. My prayers to God helped the project when God modified the keyboard to include a vertical line segment character, which allowed creating the y-axis of a graph.</p>
            <p>I also discovered the electrical darkening effect in the element mercury and worked on displays with other researchers as a freshman in the Chemistry lab. This became the so-called LCD display.</p>
            <p>I also proposed the idea of using lasers in signal transmission down a glass or plastic fiber in the Spring of 1977 during a physics laboratory experiment on lasers.</p>
            <p>I also proposed the idea of the laser gun sight.</p>
            <p>I also proposed the idea of measuring distance with a laser because gun sights can approximate distance.</p>
            <p>I battled mental illness.</p>

            <p>I helped innovate the concept of sending asynchronous digital data into an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmitter to see if digital data could be sent that way. It turned out it would work.</p>
            <p>I proposed the idea of a study of computer graphics to see if a general programming method could be derived based on graphics programs. This became Graphical Object Oriented Programming</p>
